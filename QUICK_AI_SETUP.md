# 🚀 Final Step to Complete Gemini AI Integration

## ✅ What's Already Pushed to GitHub:
1. ✅ `GEMINI_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete setup guide
2. ✅ Gemini API key added to `.env`
3. ✅ All AI functions ready in server.js

## 📝 ONE SIMPLE EDIT NEEDED:

Open `server.js` and find **line 427** (search for: `"I didn't catch that. Type 'menu'"`):

### Current Code (line 427):
```javascript
  await sendTextMessage(from, "I didn't catch that. Type 'menu' to see options.");
}
```

### Replace With:
```javascript
  // AI Fallback - Use Gemini for unknown queries
  if (GEMINI_API_KEY) {
    const history = await getConversationHistory(from, 5);
    const aiResponse = await askGemini(text, history);
    if (aiResponse) {
      await sendTextMessage(from, aiResponse);
      return;
    }
  }

  await sendTextMessage(from, "I didn't catch that. Type 'menu' to see options.");
}
```

**That's literally it!** Copy-paste those 10 lines and you're done! 🎉

## 🧪 How to Test:

1. Save the file
2. Restart server: `npm start`
3. Send a message like: "How long does a repair take?"
4. Bot will use Gemini AI to respond intelligently!

## 📦 For Render Deployment:

Don't forget to add this to Render environment variables:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBzh8RQ-e2tFgLvSYTV8XaBjtL2XgsSYAw
```
